            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <h3>Who can join?</h3>
            <p>Members of Hart House. All University of Toronto students are already members at Hart House and only need to purchase a membership to the archery club itself. As for the rest of the Toronto community, do not despair! You can purchase a Clubs Membership from Hart House. Please check out their website for more details.</p>
            <h3>How do I join?</h3>
            <p>Buy your membership at the Hub (front desk) in Hart House at the start of the term, and please remember to sign up for a Safety Lesson. These lessons are mandatory for all new members. Membership is limited, but they are annual and renewable. All memberships are good until the end of the school year, regardless of when in the year they were purchased.</p>
            <h3>What if memberships are sold out?</h3>
            <p>You can join our <a href="./join_us.html">wait-list</a> or register for the Archery Lessons held by Hart House. There are 5-week sessions for Level I and Level II classes. Level I Monday classes are 50 minutes long, offering one-on-one coaching for all participants. Level II classes on Wednesdays are for returning or experienced members only. These classes are 90 minutes long, and include an exercise component targeting specific muscle groups. You can register <a href="http://harthouse.ca/fitness/registered-classes/">online</a>. Any questions can be regarding the lessons can be directed here: <a href="mailto:inquiries@harthouse.ca" target="_top">inquiries@harthouse.ca</a>.</p>
            <h3>What about the "stuff"? (Equipment)</h3>
            <p>The club will provide all the necessary equipment at no additional charge. For the more experienced archer who just needs a place to practice, however, personal equipment is also allowed in the range.</p>
            <h3>Is it dangerous?</h3>
            <p>If you follow the rules and listen to the range officers, archery is a very safe sport.</p>
            <h3>When do you shoot?</h3>
            <p>Members are welcome to shoot during Open Range hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5-8pm. This is a very social club, and there is no minimum commitment of time to join this club.</p>
            <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
            <p> No baggy clothing as it gets in the way of shooting and the range itself can get very warm. Be prepared to take off jewelery for the same reason. Be prepared to have fun!</p>
            <h3>Archery in the GTA</h3>
            <p> Weren't able to join the club in time? Or looking for a club for your child/a minor? Please note that while currently the HHAC is not outfitted to cater to youths, this is an option that we are exploring for future years.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, please check out the <a href="https://www.classicalsport.com/">Ontario Center for Classical Sport</a>. There are also a few other University-based archery clubs, like the Ryerson Archery Club, and the York University Archery Club.</p>

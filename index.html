            <h3>What about the "stuff"? (Equipment)</h3>
            <p>The club will provide all the necessary equipment at no additional charge. For the more experienced archers who just needs a place to practice, however, personal equipment is also allowed in the range as long as it is under 40lbs in draw weight</p>
            <h3>Is it dangerous?</h3>
            <p>If you follow the rules and listen to the range officers, archery is a very safe sport.</p>
            <h3>When do you shoot?</h3>
            <p>Members are welcome to shoot during Open Range hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5-8pm. This is a very social club, and there is no minimum commitment of time to join this club.</p>
            <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
            <p> No baggy clothing as it gets in the way of shooting and the range itself can get very warm. Be prepared to take off jewelery for the same reason. Be prepared to have fun!</p>

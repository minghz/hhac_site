            <h3><i class="fa fa-user"></i> New Members</h3>
            <p>
              The Hart House Archery Club is open to adults of any age holding a Hart House membership. University of Toronto students are automatically members of Hart House, but everyone else will need to purchase a Clubs Membership or Fitness Center Membership (<a href="http://harthouse.ca/about-us/membership/">Hart House Memberships</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              New memberships will be made available twice a year, once near the start of the Fall semester and then again near the start of the Winter semester. Memberships are sold at the Hub (front desk) of Hart House. Please check our announcements for specific dates and times
            </p>
            <p>
              All new members are required to sign up for a 30 minute introductory lesson. Multiple lesson slots are available when you purchase your membership. Even experienced archers must attend an introductory lesson, at least to learn the specific rules of our range.
            </p>

            <h3><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> Dates and Hours</h3>
            <p>
              The club is open every Tuesday and Thursday from 5pm to 8pm. Hart House Archery Club members are welcome to shoot for as long as they wish during these hours. Attendance is not tracked, so members need not participate for all six hours every week.
            </p>
            <p>
              The club only operates during official University of Toronto class dates for the Spring and Winter semesters. The club may not be open during holidays, reading periods, or other dates when classes are not officially scheduled.

            <h3><i class="fa fa-archive"></i> Equipment</h3>
            <p>
              The club offers equipment for archers of all experience levels and shooting styles. Beginners are equipped with our hand-crafted, custom-made King's Pawn bows. These bows are extremely light-weight and forgiving for novice shooters. We also offer traditional longbows, olympic recurves, and modern compounds for more advanced shooters.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also offer all the necessary gear to get shooting. There are fully-fletched arrows, including extra-long arrows for those with a longer-than-average draw length. There are also finger tabs and arm guards to protect your arms and fingers while you shoot.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're not sure what equipment you need, or just looking for suggestions, our coaches are more than happy to help! Feel free to ask us anything at the range if you're unsure.
